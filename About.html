									<h1>About</h1>
									<p>We study how magmas on our planet behave during mantle melting and early differentiation. We focus particularly on how volatile elements interact with silicate melts during magmatic evolution. See below for some of our current work!</p>

								<h2>Sulfur and the redox evolution of arc magmas</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>Petrologists have observed for long time that arc magmas are commonly oxidized relative to mid-ocean ridge basalts, but the processes that drive this difference are still debated. The transport of sulfur in and out of arc magmas during subducting slab dehydration, magma degassing, and sulfide mineral precipitation can influence the redox state of magmas. Conversely, the solubility of sulfur in magmas is closely tied to oxidation state, and sulfur can act as a valuable tracer of magma redox evolution. These projects use the geochemistry of primitive melt inclusions to tease apart these processes, yielding valuable insights in magma evolution that have implications for things like volcano gas monitoring, ore deposit formation, and arc magma petrogenesis.</p>
