**_Lead Instructor of Sternberg Museum High School Volcanology Course (Summer 2019)_**

I lead the curriculum design and execution of a two week volcanology field course for high school students. We used the Pacific Northwest as our classroom, traveling up to Mount St. Helens, through eastern Oregon and down into Northern California. We covered introductory volcanology concepts including volcanic eruption styles, hand sample identification, tephra stratigraphy, and geologic field methods.
