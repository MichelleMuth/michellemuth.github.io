					<h2>Sulfur behavior and the redox evolution of subduction zone magmas</h2>

					Petrologists have observed for long time that arc magmas are commonly oxidized relative to mid-ocean ridge basalts. These more oxidized conditions strongly influence many processes, including ore deposit formation, magma degassing, and crystallization behavior. The origin of oxidized arc magmas remains uncertain. Some evidence points toward the addition of oxidized slab-derived material, particularly sulfur, into the sub arc mantle, while other evidence is more consistent with oxidation as a result of crustal processes.

					Sulfur exists in silicate melts as S<sup>2-</sup> and S<sup>6+</sup>. The large differece in oxidation state between these two species means that the behavior of sulfur is closely tied fO<sub>2</sub> . In this way the transport in out of magma systems during slab dehydration, degassing, and sulfide mineral precipitation can influence the oxidation state magmas. Conversely because the solubility of sulfur in basaltic melts in so closely tied to fO<sub>2</sub> , sulfur can act as a valubale tracer of magma fO<sub>2</sub> evolution. Teasing apart these insights can yield valuable insights magmas evolution.

					My research uses melt inclusiosn to study  his close tie between sulfur and fO<sub>2</sub> at subduction zones. Some questions I am interested in include:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
					<li>Why are arc magmas oxidized relative to mid ocean ridge basalts? </li>
					<li>How does primary oxygen fugacity affect the behavior of sulfur during the early evolution of arc magmas? </li>
					<li>What implciations does sulfur behavior during melting and differentiatons have for ore-forming chalcopphile metals? </li>
					</ol>

					To answer these questions I use melt inclusions, tiny crystals of trapped melt inside of mineral hosts. These inclusions act as a snapshot of melt composition at a given point in time

					<h2>Warm Subduction Zones: A Case Study in the southern Cascades</h2>

					<p>
					This project uses the Lassen volcanic region as a natural labratory to explore how slab-derived sulfur affects the sulfur content, oxidation state, and metal contents of arc magmas. Lassen is located in the southern Cascades, a subduction zone where very young, hot oceanic crust is being subducted. We analyze relatively primitive olivine-hosted melt inclusions collected from tephra of Lassen cinder cones for major elments, trace elements (including chalcophile metals such as Cu), volatile elements, and Fe and S speciation. 
					</p>

					<p>
					This high resolution data set allows us to study the composition of the earliest melts formed at Lassen, and minimize the signature of crustal differentiation. Our goal here is to assess these compositions, establishing whether there are causal links between oxidized slab-derived sulfur and oxidation state of Lassen magmas.

					<h2>Sulfur Cycling from A Global Perspective</h2>

					<p>
					At relatively oxidizing conditions, sulfur solubility is several times greater than at conditions similar to mid-ocean ridge settings. This project takes advantage of this relationship by using S contents of primitive, olivine-hosted melt inclusions to place constraints on the fO2 of primitive arc magmas. Concentrations of S in primitive arc magmas were drawn from a compilation of Mg-rich olivine-hosted melt inclusion compositions corrected for olivine crystallization. Volatile concentrations are calculated using the least-degassed inclusions from each volcano to minimize the effects of degassing. This data set spans 18 subduction zone segments across a range of thermal regimes, and allows us to draw comparison across arcs globally.
