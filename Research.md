**_Sulfur and Oxygen Fugacity_**

Sulfur exists in silicate melts as S2- and S6+, and the large differece in oxidation state between these two species means that the behavior of sulfur is closely tied fO2. 

My research uses melt inclusiosn to study how this close tie between sulfur and fO2 plays out at subduction zones. Some questions I am interested in include:

1. Why are arc magmas oxidized relative to mid ocean ridge basalts? 
2. How does primary oxygen fugacity affect the behavior of sulfur during the early evolution of arc magmas?
3. What implciations do sulfur behavior during melting and differentiatons have for ore-forming chalcopphile metals?

To answer these questions I use melt inclusions, tiny crystals of trapped melt inside of mineral hosts.
