**_Sulfur Cycling and Arc Magma Redox in Lassen volcanic Region_**

Sulfur cycling at volcanic arcs directly impacts climate and human society. When SO2 is added to the atmosphere during large eruptions it converts to aerosols that efficiently scatter solar radiation and increase atmospheric albedo. This addition is one of the most important forcings for short-term climate variability. Sulfur cycling is also critical to the formation of porphyry ore deposits, which contain ~80% of the world’s copper and ~95% of the world’s molybdenum1. In volcanic arc magmas, sulfur is present as sulfide (S2-) and the more oxidized sulfate (S6+). Because these two species behave differently, sulfur transport is closely tied to oxidation state. Our knowledge of sulfur cycling is therefore limited by our understanding of the redox evolution of arc magmas. While it is commonly accepted that arc lavas are oxidized relative to mid-ocean ridge basalts, the origin of this oxidized signature remains uncertain. Evidence from copper concentrations in arc magmas used as a proxy for oxidation state suggests that arc magmas become oxidized during differentiation3. However, direct measurements of Fe3+/ ΣFe in primitive melt inclusions suggest that this signature comes from a mantle source oxidized by material from the down-going slab.
