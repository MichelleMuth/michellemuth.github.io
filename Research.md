_Sulfur and Oxygen Fugacity_

Oxygen fugacity (fO2) is a means to express how oxidized or reduced a petrologic system is. fO2 is often more difficult to measure and track than other parameters such as pressure, temperature, or major and trace element composition. For this reason, although fO2 plays an important role in many petrologic processes it remains somewhat cloaked in mystery. Iron, which exists as both Fe(III) and Fe(II) in natural mineral and melts is a key part of understanding fO2, and fO2 is often viewed through the lens of iron behavior. 

Also important is sulfur, which, like iron, exists in multiple oxidation states. The interplay between sulfur and fO2 is a fascinating one. Sulfur exists in silicate melts as S2- and S6+, and the large differece in oxidation state between these two species means that the behavior of sulfur is closely tied fO2. 

My research uses melt inclusiosn to study how this close tie between sulfur and fO2 plays out at subduction zones. Some questions I am interested in include

1. Why are arc magmas oxidized relative to mid ocean ridge basalts? 
2. How does primary oxygen fugacity affect the behavior of sulfur during the early evolution of arc magmas?
3. What implciations do sulfur behavior during melting and differentiatons have for ore-forming chalcopphile metals?

To answer these questins I use melt inclusions, tiny crystals of trapped melt.
