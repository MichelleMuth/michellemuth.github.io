							<h2> Sulfur behavior and the redox evolution of arc magmas</h2>
							<p>Petrologists have observed for long time that arc magmas are commonly oxidized relative to mid-ocean ridge basalts. These more oxidized conditions strongly influence many processes, including ore deposit formation, magma degassing, and crystallization behavior. The origin of oxidized arc magmas remains uncertain. Some evidence points toward the addition of oxidized slab-derived material, particularly sulfur, into the sub arc mantle, while other evidence is more consistent with oxidation as a result of crustal processes. </p>

							<p>Sulfur exists in silicate melts as S<sup>2-</sup> and S<sup>6+</sup>. The large differece in oxidation state between these two species means that the behavior of sulfur is closely tied fO<sub>2</sub> . In this way the transport in out of magma systems during slab dehydration, degassing, and sulfide mineral precipitation can influence the oxidation state magmas. Conversely, because the solubility of sulfur in basaltic melts in so closely tied to fO<sub>2</sub>, sulfur can act as a valubale tracer of magma fO<sub>2</sub> evolution. Teasing apart these insights can yield valuable insights magmas evolution. </p>

							<p> My research uses melt inclusiosn to study this close tie between sulfur and fO<sub>2</sub> at subduction zones. Some questions I am interested in include:</p>

		                    <ol>
							<li>Why are arc magmas oxidized relative to mid ocean ridge basalts? </li>
							<li>How does primary oxygen fugacity affect the behavior of sulfur during the early evolution of arc magmas? </li>
							<li>What implciations does sulfur behavior during melting and differentiatons have for ore-forming chalcopphile metals? </li>
							</ol>

							<p>To answer these questions I use melt inclusions, tiny crystals of trapped melt inside of mineral hosts. These inclusions act as a snapshot of melt composition at a given point in time.</p>
